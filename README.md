# IRTPCAcode
The matlab code is for the paper ''Improved Robust Tensor Principal Component Analysis via Low Rank Core Matrix''. The paper you can find from https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8477047. Some functions for tsvd, you can also refer to https://github.com/canyilu/LibADMM.

The images are from the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. Work based on the dataset should cite the paper:
